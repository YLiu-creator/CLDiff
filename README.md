Cloud detection plays a crucial role in remote sensing applications. To alleviate the annotation burden in fully supervised methods, weakly supervised cloud detection has received extensive attention recently. One standard approach performs cloud detection in a pixel-wise classification paradigm, which inevitably faces category ambiguity when detecting semitransparent clouds. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel weakly supervised cloud detection framework based on the diffusion model, termed CLDiff.

Here is a short implementation since the paper is under review. Further comprehensive details will be made available upon formal acceptance of the research paper.
